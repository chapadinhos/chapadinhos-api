# Chapadinhos Api

## Project Overview

Chapadinhos is a project designed to encourage regular physical activity. It works by setting up challenges over a specific period of time. 
To score points, you need to engage in at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day.

Each challenge has a minimum number of points to be achieved. The winner is the one who reaches or exceeds the minimum points within the challenge period.

This project aims to make physical activity more engaging and fun, promoting a healthier lifestyle.


## How it works

1. A challenge is set with a specific minimum point and time duration.
2. Participants engage in physical activities. Each 30-minute activity session equals a certain number of points.
3. Points are accumulated over the duration of the challenge.
4. The participant who reaches or exceeds the minimum points within the challenge period wins.

Stay active, stay healthy with Chapadinhos!
